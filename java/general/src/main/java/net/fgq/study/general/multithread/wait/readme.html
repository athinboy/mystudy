    今天正好碰到这个问题，也疑惑了好久。看了一圈知乎上的答案，感觉没说到根上。所以自己又好好Google了一下，终于找到了让自己信服的解释。
    先说两个概念：锁池和等待池锁池:假设线程A已经拥有了某个对象(注意:不是类)的锁，而其它的线程想要调用这个对象的某个synchronized方法(或者synchronized块)，
    由于这些线程在进入对象的synchronized方法之前必须先获得该对象的锁的拥有权，但是该对象的锁目前正被线程A拥有，所以这些线程就进入了该对象的锁池中。
    等待池:假设一个线程A调用了某个对象的wait()方法，线程A就会释放该对象的锁后，进入到了该对象的等待池中
</p>
<p>
    然后再来说notify和notifyAll的区别 如果线程调用了对象的 wait()方法，那么线程便会处于该对象的等待池中，等待池中的线程不会去竞争该对象的锁。
    当有线程调用了对象的 notifyAll()方法（唤醒所有 wait 线程）或 notify()方法（只随机唤醒一个 wait 线程），被唤醒的的线程便会进入该对象的锁池中，
    锁池中的线程会去竞争该对象锁。也就是说，调用了notify后只要一个线程会由等待池进入锁池，而notifyAll会将该对象等待池内的所有线程移动到锁池中，
    等待锁竞争优先级高的线程竞争到对象锁的概率大，假若某线程没有竞争到该对象锁，它还会留在锁池中，唯有线程再次调用 wait()方法，它才会重新回到等待池中。
    而竞争到对象锁的线程则继续往下执行，直到执行完了 synchronized 代码块，它会释放掉该对象锁，这时锁池中的线程会继续竞争该对象锁。
    Reference：线程间协作：wait、notify、notifyAll 综上，所谓唤醒线程，另一种解释可以说是将线程由等待池移动到锁池，notifyAll调用后，会将全部线程由等待池移到锁池，
    然后参与锁的竞争，竞争成功则继续执行，如果不成功则留在锁池等待锁被释放后再次参与竞争。而notify只会唤醒一个线程。
    有了这些理论基础，后面的notify可能会导致死锁，而notifyAll则不会的例子也就好解释了

<p>

 Causes the current thread to wait until either another thread invokes the
 {@link java.lang.Object#notify()} method or the
 {@link java.lang.Object#notifyAll()} method for this object, or a
 specified amount of time has elapsed.
 <p>
 The current thread must own this object's monitor.
 <p>
 This method causes the current thread (call it <var>T</var>) to
 place itself in the wait set for this object and then to relinquish
 any and all synchronization claims on this object. Thread <var>T</var>
    becomes <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold; " >disabled for thread scheduling</span>  purposes and lies dormant
 until one of four things happens:
 <ul>
 <li>Some other thread invokes the {@code notify} method for this
 object and thread <var>T</var> happens to be arbitrarily chosen as
 the thread to be awakened.
 <li>Some other thread invokes the {@code notifyAll} method for this
 object.
 <li>Some other thread {@linkplain Thread#interrupt() interrupts}
 thread <var>T</var>.
 <li>The specified amount of real time has elapsed, more or less.  If
 {@code timeout} is zero, however, then real time is not taken into
 consideration and the thread simply waits until notified.
 </ul>
 The thread <var>T</var> is then removed from the <span style="color: red;">wait set</span> for this
 object and re-enabled for thread scheduling. It then competes in the
 usual manner with other threads for the right to synchronize on the
 object; once it has gained control of the object, all its
 synchronization claims on the object are restored to the status quo
 ante - that is, to the situation as of the time that the {@code wait}
 method was invoked. Thread <var>T</var> then returns from the
 invocation of the {@code wait} method. Thus, on return from the
 {@code wait} method, the synchronization state of the object and of
 thread {@code T} is exactly as it was when the {@code wait} method
 was invoked.
 <p>
 A thread can also wake up without being notified, interrupted, or
 timing out, a so-called <i>spurious wakeup</i>.  While this will rarely
 occur in practice, applications must guard against it by testing for
 the condition that should have caused the thread to be awakened, and
 continuing to wait if the condition is not satisfied.  In other words,
 waits should always occur in loops, like this one:
 <pre>
      synchronized (obj) {
          while (&lt;condition does not hold&gt;)
              obj.wait(timeout);
          ... // Perform action appropriate to condition
      }
  </pre>
 (For more information on this topic, see Section 3.2.3 in Doug Lea's
 "Concurrent Programming in Java (Second Edition)" (Addison-Wesley,
 2000), or Item 50 in Joshua Bloch's "Effective Java Programming
 Language Guide" (Addison-Wesley, 2001).

 <p>If the current thread is {@linkplain java.lang.Thread#interrupt()
 interrupted} by any thread before or while it is waiting, then an
 {@code InterruptedException} is thrown.  This exception is not
 thrown until the lock status of this object has been restored as
 described above.

 <p>
 Note that the {@code wait} method, as it places the current thread
 into the wait set for this object, unlocks only this object; any
 other objects on which the current thread may be synchronized remain
 locked while the thread waits.
 <p>
 This method should only be called by a thread that is the owner
 of this object's monitor. See the {@code notify} method for a
 description of the ways in which a thread can become the owner of
 a monitor.
